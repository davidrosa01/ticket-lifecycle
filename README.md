The ticket creation process in osTicket begins when an end user visits the "Support Center" page. There, they provide their contact information, including their email address and name. Users then select an appropriate help topic that best matches their issue, followed by writing a concise summary and detailed description of the problem they're facing. Once all the necessary details are provided, the user submits the ticket. This newly created ticket becomes available within the osTicket system for agents who have the appropriate access and permissions. These agents can then view and handle the tickets, providing the necessary support and assistance to address the user's needs.

Authorized personnel, such as queue managers or escalation engineers, play a crucial role in osTicket's ticket management. They can change ticket priorities, assign tickets to agents or departments, update SLA plans, provide summary updates, transfer tickets between departments, and communicate with relevant parties. These actions enable them to ensure efficient ticket resolution and effective collaboration throughout the process.

After resolving a ticket in osTicket, agents have the ability to communicate through the osTicket forum. They can use the forum to provide updates on the ticket's status, explaining any changes or progress made. Agents also utilize the forum to share the resolution, outlining the steps taken to address the issue. Finally, agents officially close out the ticket through the forum, indicating that it has been successfully resolved and no further action is required. By leveraging the osTicket forum, agents ensure comprehensive documentation, effective communication, and a streamlined process for closing out tickets.
